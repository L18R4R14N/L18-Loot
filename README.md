# L18-Loot
## Summary
Loot â€“ datapack that rewrites all loot tables associated with structures (mineshafts, strongholds, bastions, etc.) in order to fill chests with various structure-themed items and more consistent rewards, while retaining most items from the vanilla loot tables and also adding new stuff. An overview of the changes is listed below:
1. Added dependency of loot in mineshafts from the height at which the structure is generated - now the ores found in chests will correspond to the height at which the ore is generated;
2. Added dependency of loot in nether fortresses from the biome in which the fortress is generated;
3. In the treasure chest of the bastion you can now find netherite armor;
4. Iron armor and tools can now be found among many nether-themed chests;
5. Slime was added to the loot tables of all underwater structures;
6. Ancient City now keeps not only leggings and hoes, but also other parts of armor and tools;
7. The number of experience bottles in major structures has been significantly increased;
8. Armor and tools in structures are now not repeated for each specific chest (one chest can no longer contain three pairs of boots, instead each item will be a yet-to-be-dropped piece of armor), except for villages;
9. Loot in villages depends on the biome and profession, the chests of professions are also filled with loot specific to the type of village;
10. A lot of thematic additions in chests (cobwebs in stongholds and dungeons, different kinds of stone in mineshafts, kelp and moss in underwater structures, sand in pyramids, sculk in ancient cities, etc.).
